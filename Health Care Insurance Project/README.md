## Summary of the project
This project entails data wrangling and exploratory analysis on a healthcare insurance dataset. The dataset contains information on personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits), geographic factors, and medical insurance charges. 
Through data wrangling and exploratory analysis, insights will be derived regarding the relationship between personal attributes, geographic factors, and medical insurance charges.

## Source of dataset
The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/healthcare-insurance), comprising information on personal attributes, geographic factors, and medical insurance charges of individuals

## Objectives:
- Perform data wrangling to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships among variables.
- Investigate the impact of personal attributes (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits) and geographic factors on medical insurance charges.
- Identify patterns, trends, and insights that can inform further analysis or modeling.

## Questions
Descriptive Analysis:
- What is the distribution of age, BMI, and charges in the dataset?
- What is the average age, BMI, and charges of the insured individuals?
- How many individuals are smokers/non-smokers?
- What is the distribution of individuals across different regions?
Relationships between Variables:
- Is there a correlation between age and charges?
- How does BMI vary with age?
- Are there differences in charges between smokers and non-smokers?
- How does the number of children affect insurance charges?
Demographic Analysis:
- What is the average age and charges for males and females?
- How does BMI differ between males and females?
- Is there a difference in insurance charges based on regions?
## Installations
- Python 
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib.pyplot

## Conclusion:
The Data Wrangling and Exploratory Analysis on the Healthcare Insurance Dataset provide valuable insights into the factors influencing medical insurance charges. 
Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and impact assessment, patterns and relationships among personal attributes, geographic factors, and medical insurance charges are elucidated. 
These insights can inform decision-making in healthcare planning, pricing, and policy formulation, facilitating more efficient allocation of resources and improved healthcare outcomes
